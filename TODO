Things that need to be done...

1. mpg123 could pick up new sample rates suggested by the output modules (like a jack server fixed to 96kHz) and adapt to that.

Though the practical rates for MPEG audio are up to 48kHz ... but one could easily upsample.
Currently, we detect standard rates and resample when needed... but not new ones.

4. Prevent ID3v2 tags from being parsed multiple times after seek.

I need to carry a list of ID3v2 frame addresses that already have been parsed into the data structures.
Currently, this is a possible memory leak when the seek index is disabled (tag data at file beginning) or id3 data is just somewhere in the stream.
That being said, in the "normal" case, there is no leak.

5. What's about SINGLE_MIX?
Check what is _really_ happening there, make some test file...
