These are the necessary header files to compile the mpg123 with
sajber jukebox support. But please replace them by the files from the current 
sajberplay source distribution. The reason is, that they may have
changed.
BTW: These are the files from sajber 1.05 .. The sajber jukebox is
     under GPL.
