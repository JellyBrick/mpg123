Notes about Debian's mpg123 package
-----------------------------------

The wording in the upstream README appears to suggest that mpg123 contains
GPLed code (and thus violates the license). This is not the case, as the
CVS version of the upstream README clarifies:

  This isn't a new player. It's a fully rewritten version originally
  based on the dist10/mpegaudio (FHG-version) package. The DCT algorithm
  in the synthesis filter is a rewritten version of the DCT first seen
  in the maplay package, which was written by Tobias Bading
  (bading@cs.tu-berlin.de).  The rewrite was neccassary, because the GPL
  may not allow this copyright mix.  The mpegaudio package was written
  by various people from the MPEG/audio software simulation group and
  the used codeparts from it are also part of the ISO 11172/3 standard.
  The maplay package is under GPL .. You can find the original source
  code and the mpegaudio package on: ftp.tnt.uni-hannover.de.
