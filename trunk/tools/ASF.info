Subject: Re: Microsoft Netshow Server

I thought I was only one messing with Netshow - I'll soon be streaming our
radio station in netshow and mp3.
(http://www.gatech.edu/wrek/wreknet.html)

I'm on the Netshow and ASF mailing lists. In both the current and beta
release of Netshow, it uses ASF 1.0; ASF 2.0 is still in development.
You won't find any documentation of ASF v1.0 and it's Object IDs.  MS said
if I sign a license agreement they'll send me the code to WAV2ASF
(WAV in this case is actually a mp3 with a 70 byte WAV header).

However, by taking a mp3 WAV and comparing it to the resulting ASF file,
you can tell that it's just the mp3 with a 500 bytish header at the
beginning and headers occasionally in the file.

I have a perl script that streams a ASF file via http from a MS Netshow
server - I stole a spice girls ASF from audionet.com with it....sounds
like you've got UDP or TCP but just in case:

GET /live.asf HTTP/1.0
Accept: */*
User-Agent: NSPlayer/2.0
Pragma:
no-cache,rate=1.000000,stream-time=0,stream-offset=0:0,request-context=4

The next message I send to the list will be a script to parse an ASF file.
