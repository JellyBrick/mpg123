I'll add some more notes on accuracy and compilance here later.
For now, I just want to have it noted that indeed (as one may suspect) CFLAGS change the decoder output.
The generic decoder in debugging mode has samples deviating from the usual optimized build by +-1.
Well, that's not too surprising... when you do float calculations and convert to integer, that happens...
