- Oh... I am sure I'll find this quickly, but I am too sleepy now... I wonder if it is _wanted_ that playback of internet radio makes mpg123 daemonize.
It detaches from console.
  Actually, the second look puzzles me - this backgrounding is only happening for (pls) http playlists and is there since the beginning of pls support.
  I suspect that ppl didn't notice that, so, is it an effect limited to SourceMage systems?
  I have to investigate... and open bug tracker item on sf.net...

Old list of known bugs from 0.59r:

Of course, there are some known bugs:
-------------------------------------

- Using the buffermode, the switching from foreground to background operation 
  results in ugly noise  (-> hopefully fixed)
- win32 port: problems with option handling
- auto-config depending on audio capabilities not fully (buggy) implemented

- 0.59n/o is only tested on Solaris and Linux .. it should compile
  on HPUX, too but I haven't tested the audio part for this system. 
  It also compiles under Aix 3.x with the 'make generic' version
  SGI completly untested
  SUNOS 4.x completly untested
