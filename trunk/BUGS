Issues in current development:

- I managed to make raw output of the two spring tracks from RMB result in an odd number of bytes!
  For sure that has to be fixed ASAP


Old list of known bugs from 0.59r:

Of course, there are some known bugs:
-------------------------------------

- Using the buffermode, the switching from foreground to background operation 
  results in ugly noise  (-> hopefully fixed)
- win32 port: problems with option handling
- auto-config depending on audio capabilities not fully (buggy) implemented

- 0.59n/o is only tested on Solaris and Linux .. it should compile
  on HPUX, too but I haven't tested the audio part for this system. 
  It also compiles under Aix 3.x with the 'make generic' version
  SGI completly untested
  SUNOS 4.x completly untested
