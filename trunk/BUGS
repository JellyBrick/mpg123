Bug reports, patches:
---------------------
  Please always check the latest version from my home page
  before reporting a bug. 
    (http://www.sfs.nphil.uni-tuebingen.de/~hipp/mpg123.html)
  If you send me a patch, please use the 'unified' version.
  (diff -u ...)

Of course, there are some known bugs:
-------------------------------------

- Using the buffermode, the switching from foreground to background operation 
  results in ugly noise  (-> hopefully fixed)
- win32 port: problems with option handling
- auto-config depending on audio capabilities not fully (buggy) implemented

- 0.59n/o is only tested on Solaris and Linux .. it should compile
  on HPUX, too but I haven't tested the audio part for this system. 
  It also compiles under Aix 3.x with the 'make generic' version
  SGI completly untested
  SUNOS 4.x completly untested

ThOr:

- options parsing ist buggy on OSF1 5.1b... I get two unaligned accesses and the 
-s option gets interpreted differently depending on place in command line or if I 
call mpg123 on a shell or with execlp(). getlopt.c needs some fixes there...
