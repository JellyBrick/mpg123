	  src/mpg123.c, src/mpg123.h, src/stringbuf.c, src/stringbuf.h:
	  Too big upgrade... It is actually just about better id3 support,
	  namely adding basic parsing and display of id3v2 text info
	  fields. The code for that was outsourced from common.c - that
	  file contained too much "common" code... One change on the side
	  ofthe way is that control_generic now doesn't exit but return
	  properly so that the main routine can cleanup afterwards

2006-08-26 14:53  thor

	* src/Makefile.am, src/playlist.c, src/playlist.h,

	  mpg123.c: outsourced and reorganized the playlist code. Main
	  functionality change is that the whole playlist is read in on
	  program start (rather needed for http playlists since few
	  servers will keep up the connection for the duration of several

	* configure.ac, src/common.c, src/common.h, src/config.h.legacy,
	  src/readers.c, src/term.c, src/term.h: Disabled mmap stuff; vbr
	  seeking having replaced old stream seek There is now a configure
	  option to select frame index table size - if set to 0, you
	  basically disable it any any seek will start from beginning and
	  the read through the frames.

2006-08-21 13:48  thor

	* src/common.c, src/common.h, src/control_generic.c: a working
	  seek for generic control (now also working backwards - whee!),
	  along the way some more cleanup regarding the frame numeber bein
	  in frame struct

2006-08-21 13:40  thor

	* src/mpg123.c: to make it clear: -s gives you host byte order!

	* src/term.c: after rewind, we are at frame zero again

2006-08-21 13:20  thor

2006-08-21 13:18  thor

	* src/common.c, src/common.h, src/control_generic.c, src/mpg123.c,
	  src/mpg123.h, src/readers.c, src/term.c, src/term.h: big
	  thing... it's the initial addition of some sort of accurate
	  seeking in vbr (and strangely tagged) files. I didn't do it for
	  mmapped mode and I think I'll erase that one soon, anyway (you
	  can use stuff like /dev/shm or just trust your kernel buffers).
	  There are some changes more or less related to seeking that have
	  been necessary. Most code is wrapped in #ifdef VBR seek now...

2006-08-21 12:56  thor

	* src/httpget.c: adding workaround for rautemusik internet
	  radio... their server doesn't like the port in Host request
	  header! (gives endless relocations)

2006-08-21 12:21  thor

	* src/audio_alsa.c: make the close foolproof (instead of fixing
	  the code that calls it without having the device opened before)

2006-08-21 11:58  thor

	* src/audio_alsa.c, src/term.c: Now more proper alsa code from
	  clemens; fixing the remaining buffer mode crashes by making
	  term.c more aware of the fact that if there is a buffer, no one
	  else should mess with the audio device.

2006-08-17 07:46  thor

	* src/common.c, src/readers.c: Ok, changed the check in read_frame
	  back to comparig the new header with first and old header. That
	  is a pragmatic change that gives some false negatives but still
	  allows seeking in this one evil file at all. Blind seeking in
	  vbr files is evil.

2006-08-17 07:38  thor

	* src/common.c, src/common.h, src/readers.c: Started workign on
	  the seeking (and fixed the second-time id3v2 recognition to
	  happen in quiet mode , too, by the way). The seeking is a mess
	  but necessarily so for vbr files that we don't have a frame
	  mapping for (from Xing header - not used atm, though). Now the
	  seeking at least works for this one very vbr file (where no
	  frame is like the first!) where formerly any seekl lead directly
	  to end-of-track. There is a tradeoff: Now we get false positives
	  from time to time. We should treat Xing-tagged vbr files with
	  all the info we have and at least warn about vbr files that lack
	  the seeking info.

2006-08-17 00:06  thor

	* src/common.c, src/common.h, src/control_generic.c: One place to
	  calculate current seconds, frames to go... also introduced
	  mean_framesize to make better estimates on remaining track
	  length for vbr files without xing header (from which the number
	  of frames is known).

2006-08-15 18:22  thor

	* src/layer3.c, src/mpg123.c: Printing wanted help to stdout is a

	* src/common.c, src/config.h.legacy: Too late again... feverishly
	  hacked reading of RVA values from ID3v2 in 3 variants - ID3v2.4

	  Zee file. id3v2 -l sees it correctly; I parse the size value -
	  and that simply is wrong?!! After I've settled that the file is

	* TODO: being more clear there on gain and types

2006-08-06 17:45  thor

2006-08-06 16:20  thor

	* src/mpg123.h: should we limit samples to 2**16/2 or 2**16/1-1?
	  there will be a one missing in the first case... or is this
	  taken care of elsewhere?

2006-08-06 13:21  thor

	* mpg123.1, src/common.c, src/mpg123.c, src/mpg123.h: initial RVA

2006-08-06 11:02  thor

	* configure.ac, src/common.c, src/httpget.c, src/mpg123.h: some
	  more explicit/corrected system header dependencies along with
	  fallback (for SIZE_MAX, ULONG_MAX), in common.c the maximal

2006-08-06 00:39  thor

	* src/common.c: 1. re-enable MPEG 2.5 as I could be actually safe
	  to do so 2. bail out on free format header if first one (so
	  supposedly not just stream distortion) 3. _not_ bail out on
	  decode_header failure ... perhaps this is no good idea?

	  there are files where xrpnt does exceed that range is supposedly
	  should have (?), pointing to end+4 bytes. Since these play fine
	  now and sounded wrong with the strict check, I hope this is
	  justified. when will I have time to really understand the core

2006-07-29 11:51  thor

	* src/httpget.c, src/mpg123.c, src/mpg123.h, src/readers.c: fixing

	  - initialy made steps to HTTP/1.1 (for the host header field
	  because of virtual hosts support) but retreated after realizing
	  that one has to accept chunked data - now still HTTP/1.0 with
	  host header as extension (as before, actually), also again
	  sending only absolute paths as requests (no full url) but still
	  allowing relative redirects - using the content-type header
	  field to prevent playback of wrong codec and to more safely
	  recognice playlist files - one result: for a single we resource
	  one can always use the -@ switch: playlists are treated as
	  playlists and if it is an audio/mpeg file, it is reopened as
	  such - added most simple parsing of pls (shoutcast) playlists

	* src/audio_libao.c: Polished the libao output a bit while testing
	  it on my linux laptop: - parsing -a driver:file for file devices
	  (well, this could be extended to a general scheme to choose
	  between different driver subsystems via -a system:file or
	  system:device:file ...) - corrected the error handling: -1 is
	  expected on error by mpg123.c - giving help message with list of
	  available drivers when invalid one is specified I verified with
	  one testfile that -a wav:file does the same as -w file. I think
	  that this is good;-) Also, I'd like to mention that it's nice to
	  measure audio subsystem overhead with comparing -t and -a null.
	  With the libao in place, I'm wondering if we still want our own
	  alsa output... let's see...

	  for this); made parts of layer3.c more robust based on an evil
	  mp3 (see the buglog file). Most important featur of this

	* src/common.c, src/layer3.c, src/layer3.h, src/mpg123.c: Again
	  reworked the gapless stuff... should be more efficient now and
	  also more aggressive by just skipping decoder delay even if no
	  info found and also adding decoder delay to end (hm, where does
	  this really make sense without padding removal?). It should be
	  more efficient now; a comparison between linux-x86 binary
	  (pentium) with and without gapless code shows perhaps around
	  0.2% speed penalty through added code - which already melts when
	  gapless mode is actually active. Generally on speed: comparison
	  with 0.59r (linux build, non-marched cflags (pentium2)) shows
	  around 2% slower decoding for svn trunk; but this is greatly
	  compensated by using one of the new assembler optimizations.
	  Still, I see much code that can be improved also for efficiency
	  alone by clearing the situation with some (shared) variables
	  that don't need to be passed around all the time...

	* src/Makefile.legacy: these -g were leftovers

2006-07-03 12:55  thor

	  src/control_generic.c, src/layer3.c, src/layer3.h, src/mpg123.c,
	  src/mpg123.h: Main message: The gapless mode has been enhanced
	  to work more low-level (in layer3.c) and also to use the
	  Xing-given frame count to get the end straight. It should work
	  (tested, but not in every detail) both with the -k option and
	  terminal controlled seeking as well as control_generic JUMPs.
	  The current implementation adds some load that could be reduced
	  by putting the gapless checker code into behind flush check
	  instead of before but that needs additional care for track end
	  (where audio_flush is called externally). Apart from that and
	  some needed de-uglification it should be a nicely working
	  feature. Minor messages: frameNum is unsigned long (so bigger
	  that int and never < 0!); some parts of mpg123.c and common.c
	  did not honor these truths. But I don't claim that I catched all
	  occurences of such problems - see BUGS. Also, I fixed stuff in
	  print_stat with weird frame number estimations. Looks _much_
	  better now esp. when the frame count is known from Xing tag.

2006-06-18 14:05  thor

	* common.c, common.h, control_generic.c: added loadpaused action
	  to control_generic (again?), removed some redundant functions...
	  placed stream info generation into common.c (now adding the last
	  flag for vbr) control_generic now also has a help command that
	  gives a summary of commands and info on the cryptic stream info

2006-06-18 10:49  thor

	* COPYING: license WIP!

2006-06-17 21:45  thor

	* common.c, mpg123.c: I just had to do it... gapless mode now also
	  takes resampling into account. Some cosmetics - it needs user
	  testing now. And still the real solution for detecting the end,
	  while the current one should work in 95% of the cases.

2006-06-17 19:46  thor

	* common.c, common.h, mpg123.c: Ironed the gapless support; now
	  works for mono, stereo, 8bit, 16bit - explicit resampling
	  support still missing.

2006-06-17 14:31  thor

	* version.h: it's not 0.59r-thor anymore...
	* Makefile, common.c, mpg123.c: OK, I enclosed the actual working
	  (tiny time consuming - well, some ifs for every audio buffer
	  flush... every 16K raw data...) of gapless code in #ifdefs for
	  GAPLESS; being enabled in target linux-x86-gapless (you can turn
	  it on via -DGAPLESS in you CFLAGS, anyway). It now actually
	  works for several tracks following each other - but still, it's
	  fixed to work on stereo 16 bit layer3 files; mono will be added
	  easily.

2006-06-17 13:15  thor

	* common.c: added note about bmp album art (gosh, what a mess...)

2006-06-17 12:51  thor

	* common.c: added GAPLESS macro to enable disabling of hack in
	  audio_flush (homeopathic performance gain... not really;-)

2006-06-17 12:38  thor

	* mpg123.c: lingua2

2006-06-17 12:37  thor

	* mpg123.c: lingua

2006-06-16 22:51  thor

	* common.c, mpg123.c: restricted gapless hack to layer 3, added
	  --help info on the gapless switch still need proper track
	  begin/end and mono/stereo (even 8bit?) handling

2006-06-16 14:51  thor

	* README.new: this will become the new README eventually... still
	  in the works

2006-06-16 03:35  thor

	* common.c, common.h, mpg123.c, mpg123.h: Added a first hack to
	  make gapless output (skipping delays and padding), activated via
	  --gapless. This only works for single layer3 files with Lame tag
	  and without resampling and only for stereo now. It's the
	  technical proof-of-concept.

2006-06-14 10:46  thor

	* notes/insight.txt, common.c, mpg123.c, mpg123.h: Now being able
	  to detect and skip (even interpret) the Xing/Lame tag that
	  caused one frame of silence at the beginning. Still want to
	  implement skip of padding/delay samples based on info in there.

2006-06-12 18:02  thor

	* Makefile, decode_i586_dither.s: Added the dithered pentium
	  decode from "ACS" <adrian.bacon@xs4all.nl> /
	  http://dither123.dyndns.org (GPL, currently - have to contact
	  him again). Modified the Makefile for that -- make
	  PENTIUM_DECODE=decode_i586 ... or make
	  PENTIUM_DECODE=decode_i586_dither ... -- along with some other
	  cleanups and hints for targets.

2006-06-12 03:18  thor

	* Makefile, dct64_MMX.s, decode_MMX.s, decode_i386.c, layer2.c,
	  layer3.c, mpg123.h, tabinit.c, tabinit_MMX.s: Attempt to
	  backport the MMX stuff. It seems to work - and it's faster;-)
	  (testfile: 10s against 13s)

2006-06-12 02:01  thor

	* Makefile: trying to put env CFLAGS in place everywhere, removing
	  -D flags from generic target since they don't compile... so many
	  targets...

2006-06-12 00:21  thor

	* common.c: Finally got around to fix playback of that dreaded
	  file with a BMP (not "unsynched") in ID3V2 tag. Partial backport
	  from mhipp's trunk; now just ignoring the number of bytes
	  indicated by id3v2 frame header.

2006-06-04 20:26  thor

	* mpg123.c: The equalizer control patch just duplicated code that
	  got executed twice when usning an equalfile. Fixed that.

2006-05-14 11:30  thor

	* CHANGES, Makefile, decode_i386.c, httpget.c, layer3.c, mpg123.c,
	  mpg123.h, version.h: - applied relevant stuff from Debian's 22:
	  - fix for CVE-2006-1655 (buffer overflow in III_i_stereo()) -
	  strict aliasing hack in WRITE_SAMPLE of decode_i386.c - fixed
	  http streaming through proxy by actually using the request
	  url... - buffer resync on Ctrl-C (cleaning, reducing pauses with
	  multiple files) - removed unused esdserver variable from
	  mpg123.h - did NOT apply the Debian Makefile/manpage changes
	  (going to rewrite that stuff anyway) - made the netbsd-i386
	  targets visible as netbsd-x86

2006-05-11 15:26  thor

	* version.h: forgot that

2006-05-11 12:56  thor

	* lgpl, lgpl: it's separate discussion...

2006-05-11 12:54  thor

	* CHANGES, Makefile, mpg123.c: netbsd targets with and without
	  realtime stuff (that seems to need -lpthread...)

2006-04-28 10:33  thor

	* lgpl/KIMURA_Takuhiro.key, lgpl/fromme.email, lgpl/notes.txt,
	  lgpl/x.email: I try and I try... found some addresses from
	  internet search; mailed... ...already got some failures but also
	  2 responses (I'll add that no notes.txt later)

2006-04-24 11:26  thor

	* lgpl/inventory.txt, lgpl/notes.txt, lgpl/notex.txt: more
	  investigation for license

2006-02-22 08:28  thor

	* JUKEBOX, README.sajber: Following a suggestion from Nick, we
	  avoid having both jukebox/ and JUKEBOX. It's a question if this
	  sajber jukebox interface will keep working anyway...

2005-12-24 00:41  thomas

	* BENCHMARKING.thor: just added my benchmark; nice to have some
	  numbers there...

2005-12-24 00:18  thomas

	* CHANGES, README, README.thor: now also final thor5 doc-wise

2005-12-24 00:07  thomas

	* mpg123.c: really thor5 now (code): a trivial 0 instead of NULL

2005-12-24 00:03  thomas

	* debian/changelog, httpget.c: Debian r20 httpget fix

	  decode_ntom.c, equalizer.c, getlopt.c, getlopt.h, mpg123.c,
	  mpg123.h, readers.c, version.h: Going towards version 5
	  Preliminary result from sessions on my (well, the university's)
	  Compaq XP1000. - introduced an extra flag to prevent equalfile
	  from being used as a bool all the time (confuses compilers and
	  is just not nice) - cared for real being whatever (float,
	  double, ...) in sscanf stuff of control_generic (mainly in my
	  added SEQ) - fixed the Alpha show-stopper: mixing up of int and
	  long pointers in getlopt

2005-02-24 20:09  thomas

	* control_generic.c: final final -thor4: just a misunderstanding:
	  break means end and that makes sense.

2005-02-24 19:33  thomas

	* Makefile: final -thor4: changed my modified target to
	  "linux-static"

	* CHANGES, control_generic.c, httpget.c, mpg123.h, readers.c,
	  version.h: thor-3: again command parsing reworked; non-exit()ing
	  open functions added:

2004-10-09 20:36  thomas

	* control_generic.c: Removed load-paused function that wasn't
	  really working anyway.

2004-10-08 16:12  thomas

	* control_generic.c: added version info in control_generic startup
	  message

2004-09-21 04:02  thomas

	* version.h: version info updated

2004-09-21 03:58  thomas

	* CHANGES, control_generic.c, mpglib: more info in general and
	  more useful info on JUMP

2006-02-20 05:37  thor

	* CHANGES, Makefile, README.cfa, control_generic.c, decode_i586.s,
	  mpg123.c, mpg123.h, test.pl, version.h: Just going to put
	  mpg123-thor in here for a start; bridge to my CVS for that one.
	  0.59r-ThOr(remote-err,eq,flushing) - added audio_flush() calls
	  to various places in control_generic.c to make sure there is
	  nothing left in there that hurts later 0.59r-realeq-remoteerr: -
	  applied patch from Cool Feet Audio project (nutcase@dtfm.org,
	  see README.cfa) to use real-time equalizer in remote mode -
	  applied patch from AMF (amf.sourceforge.net) by Steve Grundell
	  for remote communication not polluting the STDOUT where the
	  audio data is read from (instead using STDERR) ... and faster
	  seeking, maybe The patches go not cleanly together, but rejects
	  are trivial. Thus, a combined patch with both would makes sense.
	  - modified (IMHO improved) the control_generic command reading:
	  now always making sure that the full command is read up to a
	  mandatory \n; also reworked the application of the commands
	  afterwards - added SEQ command: simple eq with only 3 bands -
	  added SILENCE command: I don't want the playback messages when I
	  don't read them (since my frontend is reading the STDOUT it
	  knows what is going on) - added SLJ command:
	  SILENCE-LOAD-JUMP... a hack for my hacked mixplayd... maybe one
	  should remove that again.

2006-02-20 05:11  thor

	* .: Going to start with version 0.59r as the new trunk... this
	  version is the one underlying the vast majority of current
	  patches (including mine;-). We'll see what good stuff there is
	  to port over from the 0.59s series.
