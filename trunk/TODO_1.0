We are facing release 1.0 with the fancy output modules and a separate mpg123 library, but we are not there just jet.

The library seems to work, xmms2 plugin works with it, too.
The library may need some tuning for optimal performance, but it is not much slower than old mpg123 - actually, I have to check on a number of systems if it isn't even faster on some.

The outputs need work to fix various targets.
Currently, some (many?) output systems are just broken...

BUG:
	Parallel build is broken? I had one occasion on a solaris 4 cpu box where it failed with -j5... still need to get dependencies straight?
