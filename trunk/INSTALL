(1)  Read the README file.
     (also read the JUKEBOX file if you wanna compile a player
     for the sajber jukebox)

(2)  Type "make" to see a list of supported hardware platforms
     and operating systems, then type the make command that
     best fits your system.

(3)  If compilation was successful, type "make install" to
     install the binary and the manual page in /usr/local.

Have fun!

Some additional remarks:

 - There is currently no direct audio hardware support for the
   "dec" and "generic" targets.  That means that you have to use
   the "-s" commandline option to write the decoded audio data
   to stdout.

 - On Solaris, use Sun's SparcWorks compiler ("make solaris")
   if at all possible.  It generates faster code than gcc, so
   use gcc only if there's no other way.

 - The macro "htons" causes a compiler warning in httpget.c
   (at least on FreeBSD 2.1.x).  This can be safely ignored.

 - For Solaris 2.4:  append the options "-L/usr/ucblib -lucb"
   at the end of the link command line.  Do this ONLY for
   Solaris 2.4, NOT for Solaris 2.5 or newer versions.

 - The HP-UX port might be broken.  I was able to compile it
   on an HP-UX 9 account, but there were some problems with
   libraries on HP-UX 10.  I'm not an HP expert, but perhaps
   someone else can fix it.
   [note: some people report NO problems also with HP-UX 10]

 - IRIX: some people reported compile problems on IRIX 5.x (5.3)
         but 6.x seems to compile without problems
