0.60-beta1
-----

- new license: all LGPL except the old audio_alsa.c
- merge with Nicholas' sourceforge package
	- autooled configure/make system
	- MacOSX, Jack, libao (alsa 0.9/1.x support through that)
	- experimental gapless playback for layer 3
- merged in MMX and AltiVec optimization
- security bug fixes of GLSA 200607-01 and possible crashes found by fuzzing 

UNDERGROUND 0.59r-thor7 (well, I'm going to release a _really_ official mpg123 in future) (Thomas Orgis <thomas@orgis.org>)
-----

- applied relevant stuff from Debian's 22:
	- fix for CVE-2006-1655 (buffer overflow in III_i_stereo())
	- strict aliasing hack in WRITE_SAMPLE of decode_i386.c
	- fixed http streaming through proxy by actually using the request url...
	- buffer resync on Ctrl-C (cleaning, reducing pauses with multiple files)
	- removed unused esdserver variable from mpg123.h
	- did NOT apply the Debian Makefile/manpage changes (going to rewrite that stuff anyway)
- made the netbsd-i386 targets visible as netbsd-x86

UNOFFICIAL 0.59r-thor6 (Thomas Orgis <thomas@orgis.org>)
-----

- split nedbsd targets for realtime priority selection code; since one needs -lpthread with it. standard netbsd target doesn't use realtime code -- I won't recommend running mpg123 as root anyway!

UNOFFICIAL 0.59r-thor5 (Thomas Orgis <thomas@orgis.org>)
-----

- Separated the the use of char* equalfile as filename from the use as TRUE/FALSE flag by introducing int have_eq_settings. Compilers kept nagging about assigning and integer (TRUE) to char* ... and it feels more right this way.

- Made control_generic aware of real being possibly different than float (seq command used to raise an FPE on OSF1 when this assumption was not the case.

- Fixed the command line arg parsing to work properly on Alpha (32 and 64 bit mixup)

UNOFFICIAL 0.59r-thor4 (Thomas Orgis <thomas@orgis.org>)
-----

- merged with 0.59r-19 from Debian project (Daniel Kobras <kobras@debian.org>), hopefully fixing all those security vulnerabilities
	-> my dirty http_open and open_stream variants now replaced by more proper code
	-> still my (rather workloaded) parsing/processing in control_generic, but now including the idea to watch out for \n, \r\n and \r (or \n\r, for that matter;-)

UNOFFICIAL 0.59r-thor3 (Thomas Orgis <thomas@orgis.org>)
-----

- hacked additional variants of http_open and open_stream that return errors instead of exit()ing; makes more sense when used by a frontend
- further cleanup (and return to using continue instead of nested if(){}else{if()else{}}) in command processing, better error messages there

UNOFFICIAL 0.59r-ThOr(remote-err,eq,flushing) (Thomas Orgis <thomas@orgis.org>)
-----
-added audio_flush() calls to various places in control_generic.c to make sure there is nothing left in there that hurts later (not sure if this has effects)
-(re?)enabled (?) code for stream info
-corrected answer of JUMP (now gives actual reached position, +/- 1 frame since I'll still have to figure out what frame 0 really is...)

UNOFFICIAL 0.59r-realeq-remoteerr: (Thomas Orgis <thomas@orgis.org>)
-----
- applied patch from Cool Feet Audio project (nutcase@dtfm.org, see README.cfa) to use real-time equalizer in remote mode
- applied patch from AMF (amf.sourceforge.net) by Steve Grundell for remote communication not polluting the STDOUT where the audio data is read from (instead using STDERR) ... and faster seeking, maybe
  The patches go not cleanly together, but rejects are trivial. Thus, a combined patch with both would makes sense.
- modified (IMHO improved) the control_generic command reading: now always making sure that the full command is read up to a mandatory \n; also reworked the application of the commands afterwards
- added SEQ command: simple eq with only 3 bands
- added SILENCE command: I don't want the playback messages when I don't read them (since my frontend is reading the STDOUT it knows what is going on)
- added SLJ command: SILENCE-LOAD-JUMP... a hack for my hacked mixplayd... maybe one should remove that again.

- removed duplicated dependency 'dct64.o' in Makefile


0.59c: (OF)
------
Another complete rework of the buffer system (-b option)
   (normally uses mmap(), but it can also use SYSV-ShMem because
   mmap() is broken on linux).

0.59: (MH)
-----
extracted dct64() from decode*.c files.
some changes to dct64() and decode*.c to allow auto-increment/decrement
removed bit-counter in getbit-functions. Layer3 part2 now counts it itself.

0.58: (OF)
-----
Bugfix: not closing the audio device caused a few samples to be lost.
Bugfix: audio_set_rate() was not called (!?!).
Additional command line options "--doublespeed" and "--halfspeed"
   (couldn't find better names).  See the manpage.
Complete redesign of command line options.  See the manpage.
Changed the buffer algorithm (-b).  I'm not sure whether it's better
   or worse now.
Supports multiple files on the command line.  Pressing Ctrl-C will
   skip to the next MPEG file, pressing it twice within one second
   will abort mpg123 completely.  See the "INTERRUPT" section in the
   manpage.
Support for http URLs.  See also the -p option in the manpage.
Support for list files.  See also the -@ option in the manpage.

0.57: (MH)
-----
Put the downsampling code together with the full
  quality decode into one binary. (new options -2to1,-4to1)
Optimizations in the dct12.
Removed the 'int' version.

0.56: (OF)
-----
Additional command line option "-rs" to try to resync on
   "broken" MPEG streams (now called "--resync" or "-y").
Additional command line option "-b" to use audio output buffering.
   See the manpage for additional information.
Changed a few variable names and some other minor fixes, so the
   source compiles more cleanly (without warnings) on most
   platforms (for example, the FreeBSD port compiles without
   warnings using "-Wall -ansi -pedantic").
Makefile changes: moved "solaris" to "solaris-gcc", new target
   "solaris" (using Sun's SparcWorks cc, faster tha gcc!), new
   targets "aix" and "generic".

0.55: 
-----
removed some obsolete code from layer3.c (MH)
changed scalefac stoing in layer3 (MH)
decode_4to1.c added again. Renamed decode_lp.c to decode_2to1.c (MH)
(both not optimized .. still expterimental)
Minor cleanups and optimizations in layer3. (MH)
Removed some (probable) minor bugs. (MH)
Changed 2**(...) scaling (and omitted a few muls) (MH)
Changed Makefile (OF)
Changed dequantize to reorder with a mapping table 
   (you can disable this by undefining MAP in layer3.c) (MH)
removed the 'dummy' scale step for mixed mode (MH)
Changed copy policy (MH)
Modified dequant-reorder-mapping (MH)

0.54: (MH)
-----
Minor changes in the documents .. 
huffman.c: x->len,y->len removed .. always '15' for the important cases
audio.c: some additions to the SOLARIS audio code

0.53b: (OF)
------
Makefile:

    Renamed SPARC10 to SUNOS (which is more appropriate).
        Tested with SunOS 4.1.4 on a SPARCstation SLC, 20 MHz
        (322% CPU, so no realtime decoding).
    Added SOLARIS.  Tested with Solaris 2.5.1 on an Ultra 1,
        167 MHz (14% CPU), a SPARCstation 5, 110 MHz (47% CPU),
        and a SPARCstation 10, 33 MHz (68% CPU).
    Added FreeBSD.  Tested with 2.1.7 on a Pentium-90 (38% CPU)
        and 2.2 on a Pentium-166 (20% CPU).
    Added Digital Unix.  Tested with DU 3.2 on a DEC 3000/500
        (Alpha AXP 150 MHz, 33% CPU).  Does not support DEC's
        audio interface ("AudioFile"), decodes to stdout only.
    Improved "clean" target to remove core files and editor
        backup files.
    Added "install" target.
    Added "dist" target to create a .tar.gz file of the source
        directory.
    
    In the distributed Makefile, all system sections are
    commented out.  When you type "make" without uncommenting
    one of the sections, an appropriate error message will
    be displayed.

audio.c

    Fixed problem when opening /dev/audio on Solaris:
        I had to remove O_NDELAY, because writing to /dev/audio
        didn't block until the requested number of samples
        could be written, but instead it wrote only as much
        samples as it was able too.  Sounded funny.  Removing
        O_NDELAY fixed the problem.  I don't think that it
        hurts SunOS either, so I didn't make another #ifdef.

common.c

    Fixed bug by adding function finish_output():
        The decoder writes the audio samples into a buffer, and
        each time the buffer is full, it is written to the
        audio device (or to stdout).  But when the decoding is
        done, there are some samples left in the buffer which
        aren't written yet -- they were just discarded.
        This additional function fixes the problem by writing
        the remaining samples from the buffer.  It is called
        immediately after the main frame loop in mpg123.c.

decode*.c

    Fixed compiler warning on symbol "div":
        Some compilers issue warnings because the symbol div is
        already used for something else (see "man div"), so I
        changed it to "divv".

layer*.c

    Functions do_layer*:
        Moved the declaration for audio_play_samples into
        mpg123.h.  Makes the code cleaner.

        I moved the variables pcm_samples and pcm_point to
        common.c, so they are shared between all modules.  This
        was necessary because the finish_output() function
        (see common.c above) needs to access them.

        Renamed loop variables "i" and "j" to "k" in order to
        fix compiler warnings for duplicate/hidden symbols
        (similar to "div" in decode*.c, see above).

        Changed the preprocessor symbol AUDIOBUFSIZE into a
        global variable "audiobufsize".  This makes it possible
        to change it by a command line option.

layer1.c

    Fixed error in function I_step_one, second parameter:
        unsigned int scale_index[2][]  -->  ...[2][SBLIMIT]
        This caused an error with the DU compiler (which is ok,
        because [2][] is incorrect according to ANSI).  I don't
        know whether [2][SBLIMIT] actually works correctly (I
        have no layer-1 streams to test it), but at least it
        compiles without error, and it appears to be correct
        (looking at the rest of the source).  Heaven knows why
        gcc doesn't issue an error, and what it actually makes
        from it.

mpg123.1

    A simple manual page.  Type "nroff -man mpg123.1 | more"
    to view it, or install it in /usr/local/man/man1 (this is
    done automatically by "make install").

mpg123.c

    New boolean variable "quiet":
        If this variable is set to TRUE (command line option
        -q), no messages are printed.
