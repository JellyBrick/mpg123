This directory contains some (contributed) works covering usage and/or building of mpg123/libmpg123 from different programming environments.

- Delphi: mpg123_.pas

  ...by Arthur Pires <arthurprs@gmail.com>
- Sony PSP: Sony_PSP/; building libmpg123 for the PSP (used for the MODO player).
  ...by Bastian Pflieger <wb@illogical.de>
- MSVC++: Microsoft Windows / Visual C++ builds
  - MSVC++/CMP3Stream:
    project for building libmpg123 with interface class.
    ...by "Gates Fan" <gatesfan@gmail.com>
  - MSVC++/mpg123.h
    A wrapper header over mpg123.h.in (yes, the template file in ../src/libmpg123) to use in MSVC++ projects that link to libmpg123.
  - MSVC++/2005 and MSVC++/2008 contain project files for building and using libmpg123 with the corresponding versions of Microsoft Visual C++.
    To use it add the project to your solution. Then add a reference to libmpg123 from the project that wants to use it.
    Also add ports/MSVC++ and src/libmpg123 to the include path.
