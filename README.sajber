NOTE: the current front end support is an inital hack.

If you wanna compile the player to use with the sajber jukebox you
have to unpack the jukebox directory as a subdirectory of
the mpg123 player:
	cd mpg123-0.59j/
	tar zxvf jukebox.tar.gz

Then call:
	make clean
	make linux-sajber
to build the binary with sajber jukebox support.
Copy the binary 'sajberplay' to a directory which is in your PATH
environment so the jukebox can call it.
