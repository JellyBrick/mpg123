For mpg123-1.1:

Buffer rework goes into 1.0 ... we can still make it pretty for 1.1;-)
Something remaining is the interaction of terminal control and buffer.
I think one should drop the SIGSTOP/SIGCONT for something more controlled (using putcmd/getcmd).
Then also the skipping/seeking in stopped mode should work... extreme event would be the seeking inside/together with buffer, of course, instead of against it.
