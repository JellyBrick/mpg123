For mpg123-1.1:

We need to rework the buffer.
The minimum is to get the audio handling straight: The main mpg123 should not touch anything with audio (not even accessing the plugin) when the buffer is used.
We need some communication added for handling libmpg123 format setup, that shouldn't be a big issue.

Perhaps we can make the buffer work again on MacOSX when the audio module is accessed _after_ the fork().
Then, there's no need to think about pthreads or something.
