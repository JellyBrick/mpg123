We are facing release 1.0 with the fancy output modules and a separate mpg123 library, but we are not there just jet.

The library seems to work, xmms2 plugin works with it, too.
The library may need some tuning for optimal performance, but it is not much slower than old mpg123 - actually, I have to check on a number of systems if it isn't even faster on some.

The outputs need work to fix various targets.
Currently, some (many?) output systems are just broken...

BUG:
	Seeking with remote control is fishy... aftet a loadpaused, the first seek does not seek?
	Also, do I really want to use mpg123_timeframe there? What with sample accuracy?

	I had segfaulting on Solaris while using -Z ... with -b, too, but I think I should look into -Z, as without it playback is stable.
	Nope, it just segfaulted for me just with -C -b 4096 -v ... so it's either console, the buffer or decoding as such. I strongly suggest the buffer communication. 
	The sound on Solaris is also disturbed from time to time... it's the buffer or the Infrastructure (networked terminal, doesn't necessarily have the audio performance of a workstation).
	But also, this could be an effect of the troubling buffer.
	Hm... on my Linux/i386 laptop I ran through the whole New Order list with buffer and -s > /dev/null; no problem.
	Possibly an issue showing with multiple CPUs only?

	Parallel build is broken... still need to get dependencies straight?

Possible:
	Work out the buffer stuff with audio handling? Make only _one_ process access audio stuff... (even if that may not help MacOSX).

	Make `make distcheck` work... VPATH can be tricky. Especially with fucked up recursive make.
